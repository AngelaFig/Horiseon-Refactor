# <Horiseon Refactor>

## Description

Horiseon is a digital marketing firm who has requested a refactoring of the existing code on their site in order to meet accessibility standards.  I have aided in this request by adjusting and simplifying the siteâ€™s code in HTML and by adding alt attributes to all images and icons in order to make them accessible to those who rely on screen readers.
